The CMakeLists.txt is provided to facilitate the integration of this project with other projects.

To compile this project on its own:

If you already have a installed python distribution, just compile with:
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

If you are in Windows and you do not have a python environment, a good alternative is
WinPython. As WinPython's path to "WinPython Interpreter.exe" (not python.exe, but
"WinPython Interpreter.exe", which generates a completely set up environment for cython)
is not added to your environment by default, you will have to call it explicitly:
    "PATH\TO\\WinPython Interpreter.exe" setup.py build_ext --inplace
