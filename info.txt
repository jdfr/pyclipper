rem The CMakeLists.txt is provided to facilitate the
rem integration of this project with other projects.
rem
rem To compile this project on its own:
rem If you already have a installed python distribution,
rem just compile with:
rem     python setup.py build_ext --inplace
rem If not, a good alternative is WinPython. As
rem WinPython's path  to "WinPython Interpreter.exe"
rem is not added to your environment by default,
rem you will have to modify mk.bat to specify it.
rem mk.bat contains just this line:
rem "PATH\TO\\WinPython Interpreter.exe" setup.py build_ext --inplace
