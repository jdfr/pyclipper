# Examples

A few examples on how to use the bindings are provided here:

* `ex01.py` shows how to slice a model, and how to access the results stored in `SlicedModel` wrappers.
* `ex02.py` shows how to use `ClipperPaths` wrappers. These are somewhat redundant with `SlicedModel`, but useful to work in Windows.
* `ex03.py` shows how to do 2D plots of sliced objects.
* `ex04.py` shows how to do 3D plots of sliced objects.
* `ex05.py` shows how to do simple slice processing.
